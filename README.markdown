## Intro
  * Who we are
  * How we met
  * What the talk is about
  * For experts only

## Scrum
  * Revelation
    * Empowered the team / Independence
    * Retrospectives => Inspect & Adapt
  * But wasteful:
    * Exhausting All day estimation sessions
    * Task plans that got scrapped
    * => Batches were bad

## From Batches to Flow: Mechanics of Change
  * Value Stream Map
  * Kanban board => No More Task Cards!
  * Daily Task / Hours Burn Down => Daily CFD Story Burn Up
  * Stop the Line => CI / Bugs

## Effects
  * We got even more disciplined
    * Defined 'Done' for each stage, not just an iteration
  * We were more flexible
    * Backlog priority could be changed at any time
  * We missed the rhythm of iterations

## Conclusion
  * Smaller is better
    * smaller check-ins, smaller stories => smaller batches
  * Regression may happen
  * Lean is not a new religion: Inspect & Adapt is the key.
