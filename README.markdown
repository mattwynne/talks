Gear

Pics we need:
  * For experts only
  * Stop the line

## Intro
  * Who we are                
  * How we met                
  * What the talk is about
  * Matt: For experts only

## Scrum
  * Rob:  Revelation
    * Empowered the team / Independence
    * Retrospectives => Inspect & Adapt 
  * Matt: But wasteful:
    * Exhausting All day estimation sessions
    * Task plans that got scrapped
    * => Batches were bad 

## From Batches to Flow: Mechanics of Change
  * Rob:  Value Stream Map
  * Matt: Kanban board => No More Task Cards!
    * Scary - how would we track / report progress?
  * Matt: Daily Task / Hours Burn Down => Daily CFD Story Burn Up
    * Started tracking todo as another finger
  * Rob:  Stop the Line => CI / Bugs

## Effects
  * Matt: We got even more disciplined
    * Defined 'Done' for each stage, not just an iteration
  * Rob:  We were more flexible
    * Backlog priority could be changed at any time
  * Matt: We missed the rhythm of iterations
    * show & tell / retrospective help

## Conclusion
  * Rob:  Smaller is better
    * smaller check-ins, smaller stories => smaller batches
  * Rob:  Regression may happen
  * Matt: Lean is not a new religion: Inspect & Adapt is the key.
